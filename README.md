# Amazon Affiliate Report Fetcher

A simple Rake task that fetches Amazon Affiliate/Associate reports from, well, Amazon. Uses phantomjs and [olivaw](https://github.com/L1quid/Olivaw).

The Amazon password is fetched from the OS X Keychain. The username should be set in a `config.yml` file (see `config.example.yml`).
